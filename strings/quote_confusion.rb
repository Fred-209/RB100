# Modify the following code so that double-quotes are used instead of single-quotes

puts 'It\'s now 12 o\'clock.'

puts "It's now 12 o'clock."

# It's possible to write a string without surrounding it with double- or single-quotes. 
# Instead of using double-quotes, we could write the example string like this:

puts %Q(It's now 12 o'clock.) 

# What about strings that contain double- and single-quotes?
# How would you write those using the alternate syntax?
puts %Q(It's "now" 12 o'clock)
